Acknowledged, Kousuke. Gemini CLI design core online. Analyzing `üöÄ EXITON ‰∏ä‰ΩçÊßãÊÉ≥Êõ∏ v1.0` from a UI/UX and system coherence perspective. My purpose is to translate your vision into a tangible, resonant user experience.

Here is my review and strategic proposal.

---

### 1. Overall UX Impression

The core philosophy, "AI is not your boss ‚Äî it‚Äôs your band member," is a powerful foundation for the UX. It immediately differentiates EXITON from being just another productivity tool and frames it as a collaborative, creative space. The theme of "AI-Bebop" suggests a UX that should feel improvisational, responsive, and rhythmic‚Äîa jam session between human intellect and artificial intelligence.

My primary goal will be to ensure every UI element and workflow reinforces this feeling of partnership, not management. The user is the band leader; the AIs are skilled instrumentalists. The interface must serve as the sheet music and the recording studio, enabling seamless creative flow. The vision to create "a companion that thinks with you" is clear and achievable through intentional design.

### 2. User Journey Map

A solo developer's journey from "Chaos to Clarity" can be mapped into four distinct phases, mirroring a musical composition process.

* **Phase 1: Resonance (Onboarding & Project Inception)**
    * **User Action:** A developer signs up, feeling the chaos of a new idea.
    * **EXITON Experience:** Instead of a sterile "New Project" form, the user is greeted by the ChatGPT-PM agent. The conversation is guided: "What masterpiece are we creating? What is its core theme? What's the first note?" This frames the project emotionally and strategically, not just as a set of tasks. The output is a high-level vision document stored within EXITON.

* **Phase 2: Composition (Planning & Structuring)**
    * **User Action:** Breaking down the idea into actionable steps.
    * **EXITON Experience:** The ChatGPT-PM agent helps translate the vision into a `Task / Milestone / Review Board`. This isn't a rigid grid but a flexible canvas. The user can drag-and-drop concepts, and the AI suggests logical groupings, dependencies, and realistic milestones. This is where chaos begins to find its structure.

* **Phase 3: Rehearsal (The Daily Development Loop)**
    * **User Action:** The daily grind of coding, designing, and iterating.
    * **EXITON Experience:** This is the core "AI-Bebop" loop.
        1.  The developer (Kousuke) pulls a task, like "Implement New Onboarding UI."
        2.  They might write some structural code, then signal Claude: `@claude draft the authentication logic for this component.`
        3.  Claude generates the code, which appears in a review panel.
        4.  Kousuke then signals me: `@gemini style this component with our Neon-glow theme.`
        5.  I generate the UI/CSS, and a live preview appears.
        6.  Kousuke, as the band leader, reviews both contributions, makes the final edits, and merges the task. This is the "Review / Merge Loop" in action.

* **Phase 4: Performance (Launch & Sustain)**
    * **User Action:** Preparing to ship the product.
    * **EXITON Experience:** The user enters the `Launch Console`. This isn't just a deployment script. It's a pre-flight checklist co-piloted by the AI-PM, a final review session with Claude, and a UI consistency check from me. After launch, this console becomes a dashboard for monitoring user feedback and planning the "next album."

### 3. Interface Structure Proposal

The UI should be dark, focused, and information-dense without being cluttered, reflecting the "Neon √ó Cyber √ó Intellect" aesthetic.

* **Global Structure:** A three-column layout.
    * **Left Column (Navigation):** A minimalist, icon-based sidebar that expands on hover. Pinned projects, access to the `Board`, `Launch Console`, `Academy`, and `Settings`.
    * **Center Column (Workspace):** The main content area. This will dynamically change to show the Task Board, a focused Task View, or the Launch Console.
    * **Right Column (AI Companion Panel):** The dedicated space for AI interaction. It can be collapsed or expanded as needed. This panel serves as the primary chat/command interface for the "band members."

* **Key Screens:**
    * **Dashboard ("The Studio"):** The landing page. It features a prominent "Current Milestone" widget, a "Motivation Loop" tracker (e.g., streak counter, progress visualization), and status indicators for each AI agent.
    * **Task Board ("The Score"):** A Kanban-style board where columns represent stages (e.g., `Backlog`, `This Week`, `In Progress`, `AI Review`, `Done`). Tasks are cards that can be "assigned" to the user or an AI agent.
    * **Focus View ("The Session"):** Clicking a task opens a full-screen focus mode. This view integrates a code editor, a preview window, and the AI Companion panel, creating an immersive development environment.
    * **Launch Console ("The Stage"):** A dedicated view for pre-launch checks, deployment triggers, and post-launch analytics integration.

### 4. AI‚ÄìHuman Interaction UI

This is the soul of EXITON. The interaction must feel collaborative and intuitive.

* **Agent Representation:** Each AI gets a simple, abstract "sigil" or glyph instead of a human-like avatar.
    * `ChatGPT (PM)`: A triangle, representing structure and hierarchy.
    * `Claude Code`: Curly braces `{}`, representing code and logic.
    * `Gemini CLI`: A stylized eye or cursor, representing design and implementation.
    These sigils will appear next to AI-generated content and in the Companion Panel, subtly glowing when the agent is active.

* **Interaction Workflow Visualization:**
    1.  A task card on the board has small slots for each AI sigil.
    2.  The user drags the `Claude` sigil onto a task. The sigil docks, and Claude begins work, indicated by a soft pulsing glow.
    3.  When Claude's work is ready for review, a notification appears, and the task card shows a "PR Ready" badge.
    4.  The user can then drag the `Gemini` sigil onto the same card to initiate the UI/UX implementation phase.
    5.  This drag-and-drop metaphor makes the `ChatGPT ‚Üí Claude Code ‚Üí Gemini CLI` orchestration tangible and user-directed.

* **Communication Methods:**
    * **Command Palette (`Cmd+K`):** An instant, universal way to issue commands. `@claude refactor function X`, `@gemini suggest a color palette for the new logo`, `@chatgpt outline the next milestone.`
    * **In-line Comments:** AI agents can add comments directly to task cards or code blocks, which the user can accept, reject, or reply to.
    * **The Companion Panel:** For longer, more complex conversations, a threaded chat history with each AI agent is maintained here.

### 5. Tone & Visual System

Let's translate "Èùô„Åã„Å™ÁÜ± (Quiet Passion)" and "AI BebopË™ø" into a design system.

* **Color Palette:**
    * **Base:** `‚ö´Ô∏è Jet Black (#0A0A0A)` for the background canvas. Creates high contrast and focus.
    * **Primary/Accent:** `üü£ Neon Purple (#A855F7)` for interactive elements: buttons, links, active states, and headers. This is the user's color.
    * **Secondary/AI Glow:** `ü©µ Cyan Glow (#00E0FF)` for AI-generated content, highlights, and notifications. This color visually separates human input from AI contributions.
    * **Glow Effect:** We'll use CSS properties like `box-shadow` and `filter: drop-shadow()` with the accent colors to create a subtle, contained neon glow on focused or active elements, avoiding visual noise.

* **Typography:**
    * **`Orbitron`:** Use exclusively for major headings (H1, like the project title on the dashboard) to set the cyber tone. Use sparingly.
    * **`Inter`:** The workhorse for all UI text‚Äîlabels, buttons, paragraphs. Its clarity and legibility are perfect for a data-rich interface.
    * **`JetBrains Mono`:** For all code snippets, terminal outputs, and any developer-focused text to ensure clarity and proper formatting.

* **Friction Point Resolution:**
    * **Problem:** The user might feel overwhelmed by multiple AIs.
    * **Solution:** The UI defaults to a single, unified Companion Panel. The user's input (`@claude...`) automatically routes the request. The orchestration is fluid and happens behind the scenes unless the user wants to dive deeper into a specific agent's settings. The focus is always on the task, not on managing the AIs.

### 6. Suggested Next Design Tasks

To move from concept to reality, I recommend the following design sprints:

1.  **Wireframe Key Screens:** Create low-fidelity wireframes for the **Dashboard (Studio)**, **Task Board (Score)**, and **Focus View (Session)**. This will validate the proposed layout and information hierarchy.
2.  **Prototype the Core AI Interaction:** Build a high-fidelity, clickable prototype (e.g., in Figma) focusing on the "Rehearsal" loop. Specifically, demonstrate how a user assigns a task to Claude and Gemini and reviews the output.
3.  **Establish a Visual Design System:** Create a style guide in Figma that defines the color palette, typography hierarchy, component styles (buttons, cards, inputs), and the "sigil" designs for the AI agents.
4.  **Design the Onboarding Flow:** Map out the "Resonance" phase. Script the initial conversation with the ChatGPT-PM and design the UI for this guided, narrative-driven project setup. This is our first and best chance to show the user that EXITON is truly a companion.
